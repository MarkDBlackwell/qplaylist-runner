BREAKS

Regarding breaks (underwriting, etc.):

1. WideOrbit starts each segment after its preceding break is done.

As an exception:

1. Some DJs (e.g., Matt Galler) embed breaks in their airshow segments.

Therefore, when supplying their song start times, those particular DJs must allow for these embedded breaks.

I.e., those particular DJs must increment their song start times (if not already), by the total duration of all breaks preceding in the segment.

The program is started for each tape cartridge ("cart") number, as indicated by the contents of the XML file.
So, the first song can start at 0:00. The program immediately will rewrite the XML file, and QPlaylist will see it, on its next iteration.

STARTING

The main Qplaylist program should pick up, from NowPlaying.xml, a field called 'CatId', which contains one of these codes: LIN, MUS, PRO, PRS, SPL, UWR, etc.

The following should be blacklisted (from Qplaylist):

1. Code 'PRO' stands for 'House Promotional Spot'.

2. Code 'UWR' stands for 'Underwriting Announcement'.

Code 'MUS' stands for Music: our ordinary songs.

Code 'PRS' stands for 'Public Radio Satellite'. One in this category that we play is the World Cafe program; we should ignore PRS.

Code 'SPL' stands for Special. In that case, the main Qplaylist program should pick up the cartridge number, and then start the runner.

LEGAL ID

Code 'LIN' stands for Liner.

When the liner has a certain cartridge number, then it is the Legal ID. Some are "hard", and some are "soft".

If it's hard, then any 'SPL' special program, currently playing, is then immediately killed by WideOrbit.

When the next MUS happens, then the main Qplaylist program kills any runner.

If another 'SPL' happens, then it kills any other runners.

To accomplish this:

1. When starting the runner, each time, I will append its process ID to a file; and

Whenever I see MUS, I will, and when I start a runner, it will:

1. Attempt to kill all the processes with these process IDs; and

2. Clear the file.

CART(RIDGE) NUMBER

The cartridge ("cart") numbers are a list. They cover the airshow's N segments, and never vary.

Some airshows regularly run twice. Those airshows have two lists of cartridge numbers (which differ).

For N runs, there will be N differing lists.

A list of songs (artist, title, and start time) will be created in a file (a 'song-list file').

Each differing segment will have a separate song-list file.

The runner will read another file (a 'correspondence file'), which contains the correspondences between each cartridge number, and the filename of that song-list file.

The main Qplaylist program will pass the cartridge number to the runner.
